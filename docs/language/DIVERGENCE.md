### SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC DIVERGENCE FROM PYTHON

- Eval / exec

  - There is no of eval or exec in Raccoon.

    ```py
    eval('2 + 3')
    ```

- Declaration

  - Declaration of variables, classes and funcions must be statically determinable

    Because Raccoon needs to determine a class, function and variable at compile-time, it doesn't support dynamic loading of variables, classes or functions the way Python does. It also doesn't provide a lot of hooks found in builtin module

- Type annotations

  - Type annotations is used in semantic analysis. CPython doesn't take advantage of type annotations.

    ```py
    num: int = 50

    """
    ERROR

    num = "Hello"
    """
    ```

- Fields

  - Deleting fields isn't supported.

    ```py
    """
    ERROR

    del john.name
    """
    ```

  - `vars` return named tuples.

    ```py
    print(vars(john)) # (name='John', age=45)
    ```

  - After initial assignment, fields cannot change types

    ```py
    class Person:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

    john = Person("John")
    """
    ERROR

    john.name = 54
    """
    ```

- List

  - Slices do not return list, instead they return a slice object

    ```py
    ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    sl = [:5] # Slice[int]

    print(sl) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```

- Tuples

  - A tuple can only be indexed with a signed integer literal.

    ```py
    tup = (1, 2, 3)
    tup[0]

    """
    ERROR

    tup[n]
    """
    ```

  - A tuple element can be modified in Raccoon.

    ```py
    tup = (1, 2, 3)
    tup[0] = 4
    ```

  - Directly or indirectly, a tuple can't be added to itself.

    Basically anything that makes assigning a reference/name with its previous tuple value possible is not allowed. Only identity assignment is allowed. It's a recursive problem, that static analyzers generally can't resolve and hate.

    ```py
    tup1 = (1, 2)
    tup2 = (5, 6)

    for i in range(x):
        tup3 = (1, *tup1)
        tup2 = (*tup3, *tup1)

    # Identity assignment is allowed
    tup3 = tup3
    tup3 = (*tup3)

    """
    ERROR

    for i in range(x):
        tup2 = (*tup2, *tup1)

    for i in range(x):
        tup2 = tup2 + tup1

    for i in range(x):
        tup3 = (*tup2, 1)
        tup2 = (tup3, tup1)
    """
    ```

- Functions

  - Raccoons doesn't support spreading any iterable except tuples and named tuples as arguments to a function.

    ```py
    dc = { 'name': 'John', 'age': 45 }
    ls = [1, 2, 3]
    tup = (1, 2, 3)
    named_tup = (one=1, two=2, three=3)

    some_func(*tup)
    some_func(**named_tup)

    """
    ERROR

    some_func(**dc)
    some_func(*ls)
    """
    ```

- Magic methods

  - Raccoon does not support `__new__` method since classes are statically created.

- Inheritance

  - Raccoon only support single inheritance for concrete types.

- Imports

  - Raccoon resolves imported modules at compile-time

    ```py
    name, age = "John", 45

    from objects import Person

    john = Person(name)
    ```

  - Imports in a module are not exposed to outside modules

    ```py
    # moudle.ra
    import another

    another.print()
    ```

    ```py
    import module

    """
    ERROR

    module.another.print() #
    """
    ```

- Variable

  - When a variable changes its type, Raccoon shadows it. It is essentially given a new memory address.

    ```py
    num = 10
    print(num)

    def func():
        global num
        num = 0.005 # This variable now points to another variable
        print(num)

    func()
    ```

  - Field types cannot be shadowed.

- Integers

  - `int`s are represented as 64-bit signed integers.

    This means ints overflow when they exceed `-4_611_686_018_427_387_904 < x < 4_611_686_018_427_387_903` bounds.

    ```py
    num = 4_611_686_018_427_387_902 + 1
    print(num) # -4_611_686_018_427_387_903
    ```

    NOTE: It is possible overflow checks may be added in the future.

- StopIteration

  - StopIteration is expected to be returned rather than raised.

    ```py
    class list:
        def __iter__(self)
            return list_iterator(self)

    class list_iterator:
        def __init__(self, list):
            self.list = list
            self.counter = 0

        def __next__(self):
            if self.counter < len(list):
                result = list[self.counter]
                self.counter += 1
                return result
            else:
                return StopIteration()
    ```

    For loops use StopIteration to halt iteration on iterables. Generators are inherently interable.

- Concurrency

  - Global interpreter lock

    Raccoon is not affected by the GIL.

  - Async / await

    Async / await can be built on top of go-type green threads.

    ```py
    async def foo(id):
        sleep(3)
        print(f'Done sleeping {id}')

    foo(1)
    foo(2)
    foo(3)
    ```

  - Unawaited async function may not get executed in CPython

    NOTE: The following semantic documentation may change.

    Raccoon's async / await is very different from Python's. Unawaited asynchronous functions are executed on separate green threads.

- settrace

  - Raccoon doesn't support modifying variables before the frame is run

    ```py
    """
    ERROR

    import sys.settrace
    sys.settrace(value_changer)
    """
    ```

- Source file

  - Multiple encoding support. Unlike CPython, Raccoon only support UTF-8 files.

- Scoping rules

  - Variables declared in loops or if (unless the variable appear in all branches of the if statement) cannot be accessed outside the statement scope.

  ```py
  for i in iterable:
      x = 35
  """
  ERROR

  print(x)
  """

  while condition:
      y = 35
  """
  ERROR

  print(y)
  """

  if condition:
      z = 35
  elif condition2:
      z = 45
  """
  ERROR

  print(y)
  """

  if condition:
      z = 35
  else:
      z = 45

  print(z) # Okay
  ```

- Literal

  - Raccoon does not support upper case letters to signify literal base.

    ```py
    bin_n = 0b10101
    oct_n = 0o17867
    hex_n = 0x1FFFE

    """
    ERROR

    bin_n = 0B10101
    oct_n = 0O17867
    hex_n = 0X1FFFE
    """
    ```

  - Raccoon doesn't support the wide entire uppercase / reversed prefixes Python support in prefix strings.

    ```py
    r"Hello"
    u"Hello"
    f"Hello"
    b"Hello"
    rb"Hello"
    rf"Hello"

    """
    ERROR

    R"Hello"
    U"Hello"
    F"Hello"
    B"Hello"
    rB"Hello"
    Rb"Hello"
    RB"Hello"
    rF"Hello"
    Rf"Hello"
    RF"Hello"
    """
    ```

  - Raccoon uses `im` for imaginary numbers

    ```py
    imag = 3 + 4im
    ```

    - Instead of the 'j' suffix, Raccoon expects an 'im' suffix

- Generators

  - Generators are copyable and are passed by value

    ```py
    def get_nums():
        for i in range(10):
            yield i

    x = get_nums()
    y = x

    list(x) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    list(y) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    ```

- Classes

  - Class bodies can't contain arbitrary expression. They can only contain bindings and function definitions.

  - Class base class parameters can only be identifiers.

    ```py
    class Test():
        test = 5
        """
        ERROR

        5 + 500
        lambda x: x
        match x:
            5 : 200
            _ : 300
        """

        def foo(self):
            pass

    """
    ERROR

    class Test(object=70):
        pass
    """
    ```

- Exception handling

  TODO(appcypher): This is now stale.

  - except argument must be statically-known type.

    ```py
    try:
        raise TypeError()
    except TypeError as e:
        print(e)

    """
    ERROR

    get_error_class = lambda: TypeError

    try:
        raise TypeError()
    except get_error_class() as e:
        print(e)
    """
    ```

- Comprehension

  - `if` clauses in comprehensions are replaced by `where` clauses in Raccoon

    ```py
    odds = [i for i in range(10) where i % 2]
    ```

- Keywords

  - Raccoon does not use `lambda` for lambda expressions. Instead, it uses `def`.

    ```py
    add = def (x, y): x + y
    ```
